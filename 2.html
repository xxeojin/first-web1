    <p>The result sees PSG remain top of the table and extend their advantage over second-place Lens to eight points
        <br> while Strasbourg are three adrift of safety.

The hosts were dominant with the ball, having 71% of the possession,<br>but did little with it and looked neutered in the absence of <strong>Messi</strong>, who has not yet returned after winning the World Cup.
<br>
Second-bottom Strasbourg had caused issues in the first half as Kevin Gamerio forced Gianluigi Donnarumma into a last-ditch save and seemed to be on course for a surprise draw after Marquinhos' own-goal.
